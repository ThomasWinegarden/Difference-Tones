Difference-Tones
================

A project for my physics of musics class. Constructs a melody using difference tones.
When two pure tones are played simultaneously, a third tone is heard, which is the difference in frequency between the first two tones.
The goal of this project was to create a simple interface where the user could compose a melody which would then be played using only differnce tones.

This project was rather rushed, and could use some refactoring. For now I am done working on this project.
